# CAM-ML: A Fork of The Community Atmosphere Model Implementing a Machine Learning Convection Parameterisation

This Fork of the CAM model implements a new convection parameterisation, YOG.
The parameterisation is a machine learning implementation using a neural net trained
on high-resolution cloud-resolving simulations in the SAM model as described in:\

The work is contained in a `CAM-ML` branch which is based off the `cam_cesm2_1_rel_60` tag.

Note that the `doc` folder and `README_EXTERNALS` are not updated, but just artifacts from the fork that we are keeping to be able to merge back to CESM later. 

## Using this model in a CESM Run

This section describes how to use CAM-ML as an external plug-in in a normal CESM run. 

### Obtaining CESM

Clone a copy of CESM from git and checkout the `cesm2.1.5` tag on which this work is based:
```
git clone https://github.com/escomp/cesm.git my_cesm_sandbox_2_1
cd my_cesm_sandbox_2_1/
git checkout cesm2.1.5
```

### Setting CAM version in CESM

To use this model in a CESM run you need to modify the `Externals.cfg` file in the
main CESM directory to replace the CAM entry with:
```toml
[cam]
branch = CAM-ML
protocol = git
repo_url = https://github.com/m2lines/CAM-ML
local_path = components/cam
externals = Externals_CAM.cfg
required = True
```
This will pull the `CAM-ML` branch of this repo in as the CAM component.

You can now run, from within the CESM root directory,
```
./manage_externals/checkout_externals
```
to fetch the external components. 

**Note**   
If you want to change the externals, or have made a mistake in this step, you have to delete the newly created `components` folder (or the respective subfolders therein) in the base directory before you rerun `checkout_externals`.)

### Creating and running a case

Details on creating a case can be found
[here](https://ncar.github.io/CAM/doc/build/html/CAM6.0_users_guide/building-and-running-cam.html) on the NCAR website.
For this work we are using the gate III testcase which can be set up by running:
```
./create_newcase --case <path_to_testcase_directory> --compset FSCAM --res T42_T42 --user-mods-dir ../../components/cam/cime_config/usermods_dirs/scam_gateIII --project NCGD0054
```
from `<cesm_root>/cime/scripts/`.

The `<testcase_directory>` should be a separate directory outside of the code directory, to avoid cluttering up the local repository.

Once this has been done then edit `user_nl_cam` for the case as detailed below.
This is a CAM namelist generated from the default for the case.
Add the following lines:

1. `deep_scheme = 'off'`\
    If you want to run with the new YOG convection scheme, add `yog_scheme = 'on'`, as 	well.\
    If running a comparison to the ZM scheme also add `run_deep_comp = 'on'`.
2. `yog_nn_weights = '<PATH/TO/WEIGHTS.nc>'`\
    The path to the NN weights. There are some weights in `src/physics/cam/' of this respository (CAM-ML) which can be used, or they can be generated from the [standalone model](https://github.com/m2lines/convection-parameterization-in-CAM).
3. `SAM_sounding = '<PATH/TO/SAM/SOUNDING.nc>'`\
    The path to the SAM sounding for the NN.\
    This file is generated using the `sounding_to_netcdf.py` script in the resources of the [standalone NN code](https://github.com/m2lines/convection-parameterization-in-CAM), and it can be just copied over to a suitable place.

All the paths have to be absolute, as they will be used when the code is run on the compute nodes.

We can then run `./case.setup` and `./case.build`to setup and build the test case, and `./case.submit` to submit the job to the scheduler.

**Note:**  
By default, CESM will place output on NCAR's supercomputer Derecho in `/glade/scratch/user/case/`
and logs/restart files in `/glade/scratch/user/archive/case/`.
To place all output with logs in `archive/case` switch 'short term archiving' on by editing `env_run.xml` in the case directory to change `DOUT_S` from `FALSE` to `TRUE`.

Contributions to the repository are welcome.

Open tickets can be viewed at [**Issues**](https://github.com/m2lines/CAM-ML/issues).

To contribute, find a relevant issue or open a new one and assign yourself to work on it. Then create a branch in which to add your contribution and open a pull request. Once ready assign a reviewer and request a code review. Merging should only be performed once a code review has taken place.
